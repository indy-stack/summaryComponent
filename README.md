## Overview

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

While working through this project the main focus was to practice aligning elements on the page and planning out before time in order to make the design resposive like using flexbog to change the layout of the component according to screen size.


### Continued development

I want to keep working on planning out the design and the properties appropriete for that design in order to repeat less code as possible since CSS files can get lengthy. I also want to continue working with flexbox properties. Lastly I want to keep practicing the placement of my HTML elements so they are simpler to style.
